		<p>Let's look at the US Presidtential Campaign Finance database which contains about 450,000 contributions to US Presidential candidates. The CSV file is 60 megabytes and way to large to handle it easily in Excel.</p>

<h2>Writing down assumptions</h2>

<p>In most cases when we start to work with a previously unseen dataset we are already filled up with assumptions about the data. A good way to start the visualisation work is to actually write down those assumptions, which can serve as a gentle guide through the exploration process. Here are my assumptions on the FEC contributions dataset:</p>

<ul>
<li>Obama get's the most contributions (since he's the president and has the highest popularity)</li>
<li>The number of donations increases as the time moves closer to election date</li>
<li>Obama gets more small donations than republican candidates.</li>
</ul>


<p>As a first step I simply visualised all contributed amounts over time:</p>

<p><img src="/img/ddjbook/amounts.png" alt="contributed amounts over time" /></p>

<p>In this plot we can see that almost all donations are very very small compared to three really big outliers. Furhter investigation returns that these huge contributions, which are labeled with "<em>Obama Victory Fund 2012</em>" were made on June 29th ($450k), September 29th ($1.5mio) and December 30th ($1.9mio).</p>

<p>Let's see how the image changes if we cut these (exceptional) contributions.</p>

<p><img src="/img/ddjbook/amounts-wo-ovf.png" alt="contributed without Obama Victory Fund" /></p>

<p>Surprisingly we find that a lot of the contributions have negative amounts.</p>

<p>To get more insights of the data, I chose to visualise the decimal logarithms of the amounts. On decimal logscales, an amount of $100 becomes 2 (since 10<sup>2</sup> = 100) while an amount of $1,000,000 would become 6 (10<sup>6).</sup></p>

<p><img src="/img/ddjbook/amounts-log-scale.png" alt="log10 of contributed amounts over time" /></p>

<p>Now we can see some very interesting new insights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The vast amount of contribution is within the range of $10 and $1000.</li>
<li>The contributions seem to start in three different phases:</li>
</ul>
