title: Creating KML maps using QGis

Find a map source
=================

Obviously, at first you need to find a map source. One great public domain resource is the [Natural Earth project](http://www.naturalearthdata.com). Here you can find shapefiles for things like [administrative boundaries](http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/), lakes, rivers etc. Another good ressource is [GADM](http://gadm.org), a project which provides really detailed administrative boundary shapefiles for every country in the world. Just click on Download and select the country you're interested in. For instance, you can download a ZIP that contains [shapefiles for five levels of administrative regions of Kenya](http://www.gadm.org/data2/shp/KEN_adm.zip). Notice that GADM has a non-commercial license, so you need to ask for permission if you want to use the maps for commercial purposes.

Filter & convert the map source to KML
=====================================

Now that you found a shapefile that contains the map data you need, you often need to remove all the parts that you don't need. To do so I use the open source software QuantumGIS, or just [QGIS](http://qgis.org/). Let's assume you've downloaded and unpacked the [Kenyan boundaries](http://www.gadm.org/data2/shp/KEN_adm.zip) from GADM. In QGIS you can now open a shapefile using "Layer > Add vector layer...". For instance, here's a screenshot of QGIS after loading the KEN_adm4 shapefile.

Now I open the attribute table (right click on KEN_adm4, open attribute table)
